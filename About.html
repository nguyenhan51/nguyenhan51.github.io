  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  I have been always interested in art when I was small. I got inspired by watching many animation movies and cartoons. They have never failed to fascinate me as I started to realize how amazing and powerful art can be. Being to express myself freely without using words through different types of art feels very special and extraordinary for me. At first, art was just simply a hobby for me because I enjoy drawing and painting, but as I continue to make art, I realize that I'm developing a bigger passion for art than just a hobby. Every time I'm able to make a new art piece, I always felt like I have learned, created and achieved something new. That's why I often want to try new different types of art mediums and techniques.  
</p>
<br>
  <p>My artworks mostly are very colorful can almost dreamlike because I want to create artworks that can capture my own emotions and express my imagination since I'm not always confident with words. Art has helped me convey thoughts and feelings that words can't. I also love the process of making art, from thinking and coming with an idea for an art piece to finish it. It's hard to describe how relaxing making art can be as well as the feeling of pride and happiness when I complete and look back at an artwork that I have put a lot of time and effort into. 
</p>
<br>
<p>I started exploring and creating traditional illustrations with different mediums like watercolor, gouache, oil, mixed media,... when I was in high school and constantly making art until now. I didn't focus much on digital illustrations until recently as I'm still learning and improving. In addition to that, being in Art 74 course, I'm able to exposed to new media art and get to learn how to make my works using programs and new techniques like Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator, Audacity, Meshmixer,... I have learned a lot so many more ways to make art through digital media that I never knew before which is incredible. I also found coding and making a web portfolio is fun and interesting even I still struggle with it sometimes. </p>
<br> 
<p>In the future, I hope to keep continue my passion as an artist because it's what I am deeply passionate about. I acknowledge that it can be tough can be competitive in this field, but as long as I can still make art, I wouldn't mind keep trying my best and practicing to become better. I want to be able to inspire others with my art just like other artists that I  always look up to did to me.
